## Sergiu BeÈ™liu tiny portfolio starter

Ultra-simple, good-looking portfolio built with Vite + React + Tailwind, with a nice dark mode and a serverless contact form powered by Resend on Vercel.



### What's inside

- Vite + React â€” fast dev, zero fuss

- Tailwind â€” clean utility styles + a light/dark design that actually reads well

- Dark mode â€” persisted in localStorage + respects system preference

- Serverless mail send â€” Resend-powered /api/contact endpoint

- One-click Vercel deploy â€” zero config for static + API routes

- Minimal, readable code â€” easy to tweak, easy to extend

### Licence
MIT â€” go wild
- Use it, rip it apart, ship your own thing â€” and if you do, Iâ€™d love a ping with your final result. ðŸ’Œ
